                    <li>we may delete or disable access to your account and associated data (where applicable); and</li>
                    <li>any provisions of these Terms that by their nature should survive termination (including, but not limited to, intellectual property, disclaimers, limitations of liability, and indemnification) shall remain in full force and effect.</li>

                <h2>15. Severability</h2>
                <p>If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid, unlawful, or unenforceable, that provision shall be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it valid and enforceable, and the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect.</p>
